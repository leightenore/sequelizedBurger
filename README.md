## Description

Good Burger is a full-stack app that allows users to view a burger menu and add their own burgers to it.  The user can click the "Devour It!" button to eat each burger and move it to to the other side of the page.  All of the burger information is stored in a MySQL database.

This app is a remake of the [burger](https://github.com/leightenore/burger) app, but it utilizes Sequelize rather than a custom ORM.

## Technologies Utilized:
